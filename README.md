# How to use ConfigCat with Redis

**Read the blog post here](https://configcat.com/blog/how-to-use-configcat-with-redis)**

A sample Node.js app demonstrating to integrate ConfigCat with a Redis cache. This is done by setting the `cache` property in the options passed to `getClient`.

## Build & Run

**1.** Clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/configcat-labs/configcat-with-redis-sample)

**2.** Install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

**3.** Using docker, pull the latest Redis docker image and run the container:

```bash
docker pull redis
```

```bash
docker run --name container-redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis
```

**4** Add your [ConfigCat SDK key](https://app.configcat.com/sdkkey) to the `index.js` file.

**4.** Start the app:

```sh
npm start
```

You should see the following output logged to your terminal every 5 seconds:

```bash
> configcat-with-redis-sample@1.0.0 start
> node index.js

```

By default, ConfigCatâ€™s auto-polling interval is 60 seconds. This means the cache is refreshed with the latest feature flag values from the ConfigCat Dashboard every 60 seconds. When you query a feature flag value between intervals, the result is served from the Redis cache instead of making a request to the Dashboard.
